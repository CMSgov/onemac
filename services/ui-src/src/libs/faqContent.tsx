            Yes, as long as you have the electronic receipt (confirmation
            email). Your submission is considered your official state submission
            and will only be considered received by CMS if you have received the
            electronic receipt. You should receive an email confirmation that
            the formal action was received along with information about the 90th
            day. If you do not receive a confirmation email for your SPA or
            waiver submissions, please contact your state lead or your state’s
            CMS lead for HCBS or managed care.
